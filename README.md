# Data in the wild (Numbers General Education Course), Lewis & Clark College

## Course Overview
Data in the Wild is an introductory course to quantitative reasoning, primarily using R to apply concepts to "real world" scenarios. This course is designed for first-year college students with no experience coding. Throughout this course, there are three interwoven narratives broken into four modules: a mission to Antarctia as the real world scenario, coding in R, and quantitative reasoning.

## Intended Audience
This course is intended for a general education, first-year student audience. This course is designed to equip students with basic quantitative skills for understanding our world. 

## Narrative Structure
The Antarctica Narrative: We begin module 1 with getting to know the team of students and their relevant skills to the mission. We learn about penguins and Antartic weather. We learn the basics of Rstudio and descriptive statistics. We then transition to module 2, with a sickness outbreak in the team. Students use their descriptive statistics knowledge from module 1 and learn how to create data visualizations to figure out the cause of the sickness. Students practice creating data visualizations using the same penguin dataset as in module 1. In module 3, having identified the cause of the illness as aquaculture fish, the team attempts to find new food sources in Antarctica. Students learn about inferential statistics, and perform t-tests and ANOVAs to determine the optimal fishing location. Finally, in module 4, students learn regression analysis to choose how to build a road to the optimal fishing location.

We completed the course with group independent projects based on real antarctica data.

The lessons are organized by module and week. In each module, there is a readme file explaining the broad goals. Each week is broken down into a few activities. This course uses both lectur
