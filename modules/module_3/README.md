# Module 3

### Week Overviews
Weeks 8-10: Follow that seal and those penguins!
We will analyze data, transform data to information, make data visualizations to: 
* Make decisions about how to restock our fish tanks while minimizing impact on seals
* Learn how inferential statistics are applied for decision making
* Practice framing questions that are answerable with data
* Reinforce skills of coding using R
* Make quality data visualizations supported by abstracts
* Learn what t-tests and ANOVAs are and how to perform them


### Antarctica Narrative 
We need to find a fishing spot to restock our fish tanks. We want to choose a location that will minimize our impact on seals, while maximizing our fishing potential. In the first week, we will choose between two bays, using a t-test. In the second week, we will have more bays and use an ANOVA to choose the optimal bay. In the last week, we shift our focus to the independent projects and the exam.
