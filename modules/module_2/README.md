# Module 2

### Week Overviews
Weeks 5-7:  Good Food Gone Bad - thereâ€™s a food poisoning outbreak within our community. 
We will analyze data, transform data to information, and communicate visually to: 
* figure out what food is causing the outbreak
* identify what is contributing to the food source going bad so we can fix it
* learn and practice descriptive statistics
* earn and apply statistical graphing to investigate relationships between variables 
* learn/reinforce skills of basic coding using R and the tidyverse


### Antarctica Narrative
Members of team Antarctica have come down with a sickness. We figure out that the number of doctor visits is correlated with the amount of fish eaten. We then identify what fish species is causing the sickness, as well as the cause: aquaculture tanks held at too warm of temperatures.
