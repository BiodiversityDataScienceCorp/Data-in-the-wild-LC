# Module 2 - Sick fish!

### Week 5

On Monday, Greta presented a lecture on the problem scenario (people getting sick), and then presented on visualizations: histograms, scatter plots, and bar plots. She also shared the data set (sick_data.csv), and had students in groups hand draw visualizations on whiteboards.

Wednesday's code-along (`food-gone-bad.Rmd`) was focused on creating data visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, bar charts) with ggplot using the `sick_data.csv` data set. Homework was assigned (`week-5-problem-set.Rmd`), due Thursday at midnight.
