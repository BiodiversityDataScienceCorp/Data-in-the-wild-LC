# Module 4, Week 11

### Concepts:
* Correlation 
* Simple linear regression


### Weekly Schedule
Day 1: Introductory lecture on correlation and simple linear regression

Day 2: In class code along, regression-code-along.Rmd, which uses hairgrass_data.csv. Only two of the total variables are explored. As always, we first calculate some descriptive statistics and create visualizations appropriate with the data types. 

Homework: regression-homework.Rmd which uses hairgrass_data.csv. 

Day 3: Tips on data visualizations for independent projects

# File Descriptions
generatingHairgrassData.R creates the dataset. Hairgrass density is correlated (or not) with a variety of variables, depending on the actual biological relationships between things. There are confounding variables as well (nitrogen content and penguin density, becuase of their high-nitrogen waste).
