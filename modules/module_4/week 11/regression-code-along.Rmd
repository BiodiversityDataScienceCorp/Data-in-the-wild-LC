# Statistical inference and regression analyses

### Setting up the scenario

We want to build a road to our fishing site, while minimizing our impact on the delicate antarctic ecosystem. For today's lesson, we are going to focus on antarctic hairgrass, one of only two flowering species of plants on the continent.

We want to know what environmental conditions are associated with hairgrass, so we can build a road where those conditions are not. It would take far too long to survey every square inch of land between our base and our fishing spot, so we are going to build a model based on some samples of where hairgrass is found to predict where else it might be.

We collected data for one month on key components of the hairgrass' environment

-   soil pH : most plants prefer mildly acidic to neutral environments

-   nitrogen content (as percentage per 100 mL soil sample) : important for plant growth and tissue building

-   phosphorous content (as percentage per 100 mL soil sample) : important for plant growth and tissue building

-   percent soil rock : rockiness of soil impacts water drainage and temperature

-   max windpseed knots : extreme wind can pose a challenge to plants of all types

-   average UV index : plants can get sunburned too

-   average summer temperature

-   average winter temperature

-   penguin density within 100 m : the number of penguins per 5 m sq within 100 m of the sample quadrant for hairgrass

-   hairgrass density (measured as number of individual clumps of hairgrass within 1 square meter)

### Exploring and analyzing our first variables of interest

There are many environmental conditions that may be associated with hairgrass density. For today's code along, we are going to focus on two: soil pH and nitrogen content.

Let's look at nitrogen content first.

We always should start with a data visualization and some descriptive statistics.

```{r}
# load in the tidyverse
library("tidyverse")
# load in the data
hairgrass <- read_csv("hairgrass_data.csv")
```

```{r}

```

Now let's actually calculate the correlation coefficient, r. As a reminder, the correlation coefficient is a number between -1 and 1 that kooks at the relationship between two numeric variables. The greater the magnitude of the correlation coefficient, the stronger the correlation (All the points fall exactly on the line of best fit if r = 1 or -1).

```{r}

```

We often think about the correlation in terms of r-squared. All we have to do is square the value we calculated above. How do we interpret r-squared for this relationship?
```{r}

```


Adding our line of best fit to the data

```{r}


```

If we want to add statistical rigor, we need to use regression analysis. A regression analysis approximates the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables and evaluates the strength of that relationship (giving us a p-value).

We will use linear regressions in this unit. This simply means that the model will take the form of y = ax + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the dependent variable, a is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.

What would the model for our question about nitrogen content be? (it's okay that we haven't yet calculated the values)

```{r}

```

What is the null hypothesis? What is the alternative hypothesis?

```{r}


```

R can actually calculate what this model would be for us. The formula for the line of best fit (y = mx+b) aims to minimize the distance between each observation (point) and the line. What is the model?

```{r}

```

So what can we conclude about soil pH and hairgrass density?

```{r}

```

Moving on to soil pH

Data visualization, with the line of best fit, and summary statistics for soil pH

```{r}

```

What is the correlation coefficient?

```{r}

```

What is the model for our question about soil pH, without values?

```{r}

```

Create the model in R and calculate the values for a and b.

```{r}

```

At alpha = 0.05, what do we conclude about the relationship between soil pH and hairgrass density and why?

```{r}

```

What does this mean for the road we are building?

```{r}

```
