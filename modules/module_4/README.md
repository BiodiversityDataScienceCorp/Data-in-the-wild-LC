# Module 4 

### Week Overviews
Weeks 11-13: March of the Penguins
We will analyze data, transform data to information, make data visualizations to: 
* Decide where to build a road to access the new fishing sites on a path that minimizes impact on a variety of Antarctic species 
* Reinforce and solidify independent application of statistics and data science


### Antarctica Narrative 
The narrative: We want to build a road between our camp and fishing spot. We want to minimize our impact on the antarctic ecosystem and not destroy the habitat or living quarters of many species. We can't measure every inch of land between the fishing spot and camp, so we are going to approximate the distribution of a few key species. We aren't going to do species distribution in all its glory. Instead, we are going to do a series of linear regressions, approximating hairgrass (one of two flowering plants in the antarctic) density with a variety of environmental  variables as a demonstration. We will find what variables are correlated with hairgrass and choose to not build a road where we find those qualities. We then will look at species distribution models of hairgrass and other species to actually decide where to build the road. 

Quantitative skills: Students will learn what correlations and linear regressions are. 

Coding skills: Students will create scatter plots with lines of best fit in ggplot. Students will perform correlation analysis and linear regression  (both simple and multiple).
