# In-class practice with grouping data

### Your Name (replace me)

### September 16, 2022

Remember: you can reference *Analyze data with R.Rmd* and consult Google for help with commands!

First we need to load the penguin data set, just like last week. The dataset will be called *penguins* This data was collected by real scientists! Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins

library(tidyverse) # to make tidyverse commands available 
```

1.  Create a vector that is the subset of the data with only penguins that live on Torgersen. How many penguins is this?

```{r}
penguins <- na.omit(penguins)

torg <- filter(penguins, island == "Torgersen")
torg
```

2.  Of the penguins that live on Torgersen, how many have flippers shorter than 190mm?

```{r}
torgShort <- filter(torg, flipper_length_mm < 190)
torgShort

```

3.  Of the penguins that live on Torgersen, what percentage are female?

```{r}

torgFemalePerc <- torg %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(percent=n()/nrow(torg))

torgFemalePerc

```

There are three different species of penguins in this dataset. We can see from the photo below that they may have different body dimensions.

4.  What is the mean and standard deviation of body mass for each penguin species? (Hint: use group_by/summarize)

```{r}

massSummary <- penguins %>% group_by(species) %>% summarize(avgMass=mean(body_mass_g), sdMass=sd(body_mass_g))

massSummary
```

5.  What is the mean and standard deviation of bill length for each penguin species?

```{r}
lengthSummary <- penguins %>% group_by(species) %>% summarize(avgLength=mean(bill_length_mm), sdLength=sd(bill_length_mm))

lengthSummary
```

The penguins live on different islands. The islands are different sizes and located in different locations within the Palmer Archipelago. This could affect the avaibility of prey, habitat, etc.

6\. Do the Adelie penguins living on Torgersen Island have a different mean body mass than the Adelie penguins living on Biscoe?

```{r}
# one way is using filters and later calulating mass

# first create vectors that are 1. only Adelie on Torgersen and 2. only Adelie on Biscoe
adelieTorgersen <- filter(penguins, island=="Torgersen" & species=="Adelie")
adelieTorgersen
adelieBiscoe <- filter(penguins, island=="Biscoe" & species=="Adelie")
adelieBiscoe

# then caclulate the average mass of each of those subsets
adelieTorgersenMass <- mean(adelieTorgersen$body_mass_g)
adelieTorgersenMass 

adelieBiscoeMass <- mean(adelieBiscoe$body_mass_g)
adelieBiscoeMass



# another way is using group by with multiple criteria, search through the table to find the rows that show Adelies on Torgersen and Biscoe
massByIslandSpecies <- penguins %>% group_by(island, species) %>% summarize(avgMass=mean(body_mass_g), sdMass=sd(body_mass_g))

massByIslandSpecies

```

7. Do the female Adelie penguins living on Torgersen Island have a different mean body mass than the female Adelie penguins living on Biscoe? Calculate both the mean and standard deviation of body mass for both groups.

```{r}

# one way is using filters and later calulating mass

# first create vectors that are 1. only Adelie on Torgersen and 2. only Adelie on Biscoe
adelieTorgersenF <- filter(penguins, island=="Torgersen" & species=="Adelie" & sex=="female")
adelieTorgersenF
adelieBiscoeF <- filter(penguins, island=="Biscoe" & species=="Adelie" & sex=="female")
adelieBiscoeF

# then caclulate the average mass of each of those subsets
adelieTorgersenMassF <- mean(adelieTorgersenF$body_mass_g)
adelieTorgersenSdF<-sd(adelieTorgersenF$body_mass_g)
adelieTorgersenMassF
adelieTorgersenSdF

adelieBiscoeMassF <- mean(adelieBiscoeF$body_mass_g)
adelieBiscoeSdF <- sd(adelieBiscoeF$body_mass_g)
adelieBiscoeMassF
adelieBiscoeSdF

```

8.  What is the maximum bill depth of penguins for each island?

```{r}
billByIsland <- penguins %>% group_by(island) %>% summarize(maxDepth=max(bill_depth_mm)) 
billByIsland

```

9.  What is the percentage of female penguins present in the entire dataset?

```{r}
femalePerc <- penguins %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarise(percent=n()/nrow(penguins))

femalePerc

```

10. During which year did the scientists measure the most penguins? (Hint: how many penguins are in the data set per year)

```{r}

yearCounts <- penguins %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(count=n())
yearCounts

```

11. What species of penguin live on each island?

```{r}
speciesByIsland <- penguins %>% group_by(species) %>% summarize(penguinSp=unique(island)) 
speciesByIsland

# on Torgersen
# Adelie only 

# on Biscoe
# Adelie and Gentoo

# on Dream
#Adelie and Chinstrap

```
