### Antarctica Narrative
We start en route to Antarctica! We took a survey to get to know our teammates, their skills, and choose a mascot. We land and learn about the weather of a few research stations there. We use the palmer penguin data set for practice, which is real data collected on the Palmer archipeligo in Antarctica.
