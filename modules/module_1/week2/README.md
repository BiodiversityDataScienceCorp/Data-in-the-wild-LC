# Module 1, Week 2

### Concepts:

-   assigning variables
-   creating vectors
-   functions & arguments
-   loading data from csv
-   creating vectors from columns of data
-   calculating mean, median, standard deviation

### Week Schedule

Day 1: Labor Day

Day 2: In class code along using introToR.Rmd. introToR.Rmd teaches the basics of assigning variables, camel case (and other best practices), loading data sets, and calculating measures of central tendency. The data set we used was teamAntarcticaData.csv. This contains the students' responses to a google form we created, asking them about various measures of skills relevant to our Antarctic mission.

Post-class Homework: problemSet1.Rmd.

Day 3: In class group work on penguinPractice1.Rmd. Students worked in groups of 4 with teaching staff present to answer questions. Reinforces the same coding skills as introToR.Rmd.

### Description

This was a short week due to Labor Day. On Wednesday, we had our first code-along: Intro to R.Rmd. Students were then required to complete and submit problem-set.Rmd by Thursday at midnight. On Friday, the class did group work with Penguin_Practice_No1.Rmd. Friday's session was done in the Watzek Library Classroom, which seemed to really help facilitate group work.
