# Introduction to R/RStudio  

## Learning Outcomes
* Students will be able to describe what computer programming languages (code) are,
with R as an example.
* Students will be able to describe the role of RStudio in programming with R.
* Students will be able to describe the utility of each panel in RStudio.  
* Students will be able to perform basic math functions in the R console.

## Check-in (5 minutes)

Let's all sign-up for RStudio Cloud!

## RStudio exploration (10 minutes)

Open up RStudio Cloud. Spend some time familiarizing
yourself with the structure of what is in front of you. Individually, come up with
a question or something you don't really understand about R/RStudio. Be ready to report out.  

## Rstudio Mini-tour (10 minutes)  

Link to Google Slides for R/RStudio:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lmOLhi2mhIYukCXQ9kw35FnawlIuIPVd51V4aUCFxkU/edit?usp=sharing

Perform a live-coding mini-tour of RStudio.   
1. What the different panels do  
2. Navigating file structures in the files pane  
3. What is a working directory?  
4. Console versus a script/Rmarkdown file?  
5. Getting help!  

## Using R as a calculator - getting comfortable with the console  
You can do basic math in the console (the bottom left part of the screen). For example:
```{r}
3+5

45^7

890*4.76523
```

## Math - Group Challenge  
Run the following equation in the console. You'll need to be creative, dig into the helpfiles and probably the web to figure out a few of the more complicated operations.  Be ready to share your code.  

The log (base 10) of the square root of pi, raised to the power of 12.

```{r}
log10(sqrt(pi))^12
```
