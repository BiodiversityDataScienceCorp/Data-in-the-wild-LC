# Introduction to R and Data Concepts

## September 7th, 2022

### Goals

-   Gain some familiarity and comfort with rstudio
-   Review how to assign variables
-   Learn about and use functions
-   Learn about and use vectors
-   Write code to work with a data set, and calculate some descriptive statistics

### Arithmetic

The grey rectangle below is a "code chunk". Everything withing the grey area is interpreted as R code. To run the code, click the green triangle in the upper-right corner.

In this example, R can perform basic math:

```{r}

2+2

```

Now it's your turn. Enter code below to subtract ten from twenty-two:

```{r}

22-10

```

#### Assigning Variables

We'll be working a lot with variables throughout this semester. A variable is a name you give to some value. The value could be a single number, a word, a bunch of words, an entire data set, etc.

Most scripting languages use the "=" sign to assign a value to a variable, but R uses "\<-".

```{r}
# assigns 10 to x
x<-10

```

It's important to note that creating a new variable using code above doesn't give you any output. Often it's a good idea to print your variable to the screen, just to confirm it worked the way you intended:

```{r}
# prints x
x

#Anything preceded by a "#" is a "comment". It does not get executed as code.
#Comments can be super helpful to provide info on your code.
```

Now it's your turn. Create a variable "y", set it equal to 7+9, and then print it out:

```{r}

y<-7+9
y




```

#### Functions

Coding languages, including R, have functions that help you quickly execute common tasks. Functions typically take the form of:

functionName(argument1, argument2, etc....)

*Arguments* are the inputs you send to a function, so it has all the information it needs to perform its operation.

For example, the function `sqrt(number)` takes the square root of a number. This lets us quickly compute the answer, rather than having to write the formula for a square root.

```{r}
sqrt(9)
```

YOUR TURN: In the chunk below, create a variable `z`, set it equal to the square root of 90, and print it out:

```{r}
z<-sqrt(90)
z

```

One nice thing about rstudio is that you can readily access documentation for functions by using the "help" command:

```{r}
help(sqrt)
```

The documentation appears in the lower right window in the "help" tab.

One key question: how do you know what functions exist, and what they do?\
Answer: you Google what you're trying to do! In the case of R, you might search "How do I do 'x' in R?"

Let's say you are interested in calculating the absolute value (positive distance from zero) of -35 in R. Take a moment with your group/neighbors, and try to find the answer by searching the internet. In the code chunk below, use the function you found to compute this calculation:

```{r}
# compute the absolute value of -35



```

#### Vectors

So far we've created variables that have single values (e.g. `x<-7`), but there are often cases where we need to assign *multiple values* to a variable. These types of variables are called *vectors*.

In order to create a vector, you can use the "c" function (c stands for "combine"). Here's an example:

```{r}

myFirstVector<-c(3,7,1,10)

myFirstVector

```

Now it's your turn. Create a vector called `mySecondVector`, assign the values 8, -11, 100, 35 to it, and print it to the screen:

```{r}
# use the "c" function to create mySecondVector:


```

Before moving on, let's talk a little about variable naming conventions. We started out using `x`, `y`, and `z` when learning about variables. That technically works, but it's better practice to be more descriptive in your variable names. The examples above and below use a syntax called "camel case". This allows you to string words together without spaces, but preserves quick readability. From this point on, we're going to create variables with camel case - you should too!

![](camelCase.png){width="400"}

It may not be immediately clear what the utility of vectors is, so let's take a look at a practical use case. Below is a vector containing the responses from you and your classmates (and U of Arizona students) on self-reported fishing skill (1 being low, 5 being high):

```{r}


fishingSkill<-c(1,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,5,1,2,2,1,5,3,4,4,4,2,1,2,2,3,2,1,2,2,2,1,5,2,3,1,4,5,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,2,2,5,3,1,1,1,1,2,1,3,2,5,1,2,3,3,2,3,5,2)

fishingSkill

```

Let's say we're interested in finding the average of all the responses. We can do this by use the `mean` function in R: (we'll dive more into descriptive statistics next week, and how they differ from inferential)

```{r}

avgFishingSkill<-mean(fishingSkill)

avgFishingSkill


```

We can also calculate the median (the "middle" value, when data is in numerical order) with the `median` function:

```{r}

medianFishingSkill<-median(fishingSkill)

medianFishingSkill

```

We can also calculate the standard deviation (a measurement of how spread apart the data is):

```{r}
sdFishingSkill<-sd(fishingSkill)

sdFishingSkill
```

Now it's your turn. Given the vector below of self-reported cooking skill ranking, calculate its mean, median, and standard deviation:

```{r}

cookingSkill<-c(4,5,4,1,2,5,4,4,4,4,3,2,2,2,4,4,4,3,3,5,3,3,4,4,5,5,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,4,1,4,3,4,1,4,2,3,2,4,2,2,2,4,4,1,5,3,3,4,2,4,2,3,3,2,1,3,4,2,5,5,3,5,4,2,4,4,3,3,4,4)

# calculate the mean

#calculate median

# calculate the standard deviation



```

### Working with a data set

One of the most common uses of R is to load a data set into R as a variable, and then use that data to ask and answer questions with code. Let's start off by loading a package called the Tidyverse. The Tidyverse is a series of functions written by data scientists to make working with data a little easier. We can load it by running the following command:

```{r}

library(tidyverse)


```

Notice in the Files tab in the lower-right window, there is a file titled teamAntarcticaData.csv. This is a copy of the [spreadsheet data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GDT4v6cu41-cfhNkzyrrobsuAbhzlW8GEqJxdAJZDLM/edit#gid=1722229028){target="_blank"} from the Google form. Below, we can assign the entire data set to a variable using the `read_csv` function:

```{r}
#load the data
teamAntarcticaData<-read_csv("teamAntarcticaData.csv")

#print to screen
teamAntarcticaData


```

Earlier in this exercise we looked at the array of responses for both fishing and cooking aptitude, though in both cases the vectors were hand-typed (by me). A much more common way to acquire, and then use, a vector of data is to directly query the data set. You can get a vector (a.k.a. column) of data by using the following syntax:

`dataSet$columnName`

Let's get all responses for fishing aptitude directly from the data set:

```{r}

fishing<-teamAntarcticaData$fishing

fishing

```

And just like before, we can calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation:

```{r}

mean(fishing)

median(fishing)

sd(fishing)
     
     

```

Now it's your turn:

Use the data set to get the column values for tolerance of cold (hint: after typing the \$, use auto-complete to select the column name). Calculate its mean, median, and standard deviation.

```{r}

# create a vector that contains the column values for cold tolerance



#calculate the mean


#calculate the median


# calculate the standard deviation



```

Now do the same for bedside manner:

```{r}

# create a vector that contains the column values for bedside manner



#calculate the mean


#calculate the median


# calculate the standard deviation

```

Now create a vector to get the responses for parka color. How is this data different from the other examples we've seen? What can we learn from the data?

```{r}






```
