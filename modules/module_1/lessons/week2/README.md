# Module 1, week 2

### Concepts introduced:
* assigning variables 
* creating vectors 
* functions & arguments 
* loading data from csv 
* creating vectors from columns of data 
* calculating mean, median, standard deviation 


This was a short week due to Labor Day. On Wednesday, we had our first code-along: Intro to R.Rmd. Students were then required to complete and submit problem-set.Rmd by Thursday at midnight. On Friday, the class did group work with Penguin_Practice_No1.Rmd. Friday's session was done in the Watzek Library Classroom, which seemed to really help facilitate group work.
